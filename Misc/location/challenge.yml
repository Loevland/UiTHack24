    The aliens have captured one of our crew members and is holding him hostage. Luckily, he managed to send us a picture of his surroundings. Can you figure out where he is being held captive?

    The flag is the city where this picture was taken, in lowercase, wrapped in UiTHack24{}. If you encouter any acute accent characters (e.g. à) in the city name, replace them with their non-accented counterparts (e.g. a).
