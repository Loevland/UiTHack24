    Hey it's me, JC.
    I've heard you could use some help, so I whipped up something special just for you.
    Make you sure you go to the right place. Oh, and you will also need a 4-digit code for the padlock.
    Don't worry, If you know me you probably already know the code. 
    If not, you'll just have to learn to immerse yourself in the simulation.
