# Noob - Noob2
> Noob - 100pts

Our flag was stolen once again. This time we think they have `hidden` it. Can you get it back for us?

You can connect to the server with the following command: `nc uithack.td.org.uit.no 6001`
The username is `noob2`
The password is the flag you found in `noob1`

Read up on the `ls` command to get the flag
