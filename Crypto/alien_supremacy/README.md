> Crypto - 423pts/23 solves

The aliens have composed a challenge for the petty humans using their own game against them - CHESS. Play out the sequence using the best possible moves starting as white. A chess piece move is represented by first stating where the piece moved from to where it is going.

Hint 1. White has forced mate in 4 moves.
