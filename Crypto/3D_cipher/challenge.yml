    While I was navigating through Earth's space debris on my way to the moon, 
    I came across a fascinating discovery - a Rubik's cube floating alongside a computer. 
    My curiosity piqued, I decided to inspect the computer, 
    unveiling not only an encryption algorithm,
    but also some encrypted text! I need your help to decipher it.
