# Crypto - Alienware

> crypto - 200pts

Aliens have encrypted my very important file! Luckily they forgot to delete the software from the trash folder, can you help me decrypt it?

Files: [Source code](src/word.py) [Encrypted file](src/Stardust-reckoning.txt.enc)

int 1. The aliens have probably not figured out truly random numbers either.

Hint 2. I think the file might have been tampered with.
