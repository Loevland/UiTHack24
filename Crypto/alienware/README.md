# Alienware
> Crypto - 499pts/4 solves

Aliens have encrypted my very important file! Luckily they forgot to delete the software from the trash folder, can you help me decrypt it?

Files:
- [Source code](src/word.py)
- [Encrypted file](src/Stardust-reckoning.txt.enc)

Hint 1. The aliens have probably not figured out truly random numbers either.
